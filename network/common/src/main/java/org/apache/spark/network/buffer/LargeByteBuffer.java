/**
 * A byte buffer which can hold over 2GB.
 * <p/>
 * This is roughly similar {@link java.nio.ByteBuffer}, with a limited set of operations relevant
 * to use in Spark, and without the capacity restrictions of a ByteBuffer.
 * <p/>
 * Unlike ByteBuffers, this is read-only, and only supports reading bytes (with both single and bulk
 * <code>get</code> methods).  It supports random access via <code>skip</code> to move around the
 * buffer.
 * <p/>
 * In general, implementations are expected to support O(1) random access.  Furthermore,
 * neighboring locations in the buffer are likely to be neighboring in memory, so sequential access
 * will avoid cache-misses.  However, these are only rough guidelines which may differ in
 * implementations.
 * <p/>
 * Any code which expects a ByteBuffer can obtain one via {@link #asByteBuffer} when possible -- see
 * that method for a full description of its limitations.
 * <p/>
 * Instances of this class can be created with
 * {@link org.apache.spark.network.buffer.LargeByteBufferHelper},
 * with a LargeByteBufferOutputStream,
 * or directly from the implementation
 * {@link org.apache.spark.network.buffer.WrappedLargeByteBuffer}.
